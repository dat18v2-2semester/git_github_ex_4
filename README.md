# Exercise 4 - Git & Github - Fork and pull requests

# Fork

**One group member** should create a new project, git initialize it and push it to a new Github repository.    
**Other group members** should this time not have push access (edeting rights) to the repository.    

**Each of the other group members** should now **fork** this repository.
**Each of the other group members** should clone this forked repository so you all have a local version on your computer.    

**Each of the other group members** should create a branch and make some changes to the code.     
**Each of the other group members** should ```` add, commit, push ```` (to your own private github account).

**Each of the other group members** should create a ````pull request````    

**The Master group member** should now review the suggestions and merge it into his master project. If nessesary also merge the branch into the master branch.    

Now you all switch roles and do the exercise again.
